      <h2>What is Migration</h2>
      <p>
        Migration is
        <b> <ins style="font-size: x-large;"> not only a physically explained displacement</ins> </b> event, but
        also a sociologically significant change and self-renewal event. Even if
        there is a reason for this displacement,
        <b>
          <ins
            >it is an indication that there is a defect that needs to be
            repaired</ins
          >
        </b>
        or a gap that needs to be filled. Because if the conditions are as they
        should be, there is no search for a new home, no change is observed. In
        this case, it is clear that migration is a movement that seeks to
        achieve better and more efficient. In its simplest form, migration is an
        instinctive behavior.

        It is divided into the first period and the second period. The first
        period of tribes migration includes intense

        </b>
        The migration of tribes in the second period is a continuation of the
        first period. The Hun group, which moved west around 350 BC  <span style="color: red; font-size: x-large;"><ins>get rid
        of Chinese domination in Central Asia</ins> </span> , caused the Huns living between
        the Volga-Don rivers to migrate further west. At that time, the Goths,
        who were from the Germanic tribes, and the Proto-Slavs, the ancestors of
        the present-day Slavic peoples, lived in the plains to the north of the
        Black Sea. In 375, the Huns entered this region where the Goths and
        Proto-Slavs lived.

      <h2>Reasons of Migration of Tribes</h2>
      <p>
        Apart from the pressure of the Chinese and Avars,
        <b
          ><span style="color: red ; font-size: x-large;" 
            >the worsening of climatic conditions and drought</span
          >
        </b>
        is a situation that increases the desire and necessity of migration.
        <b><span style="color: red">The struggles between the tribes</span> </b>
        is also an event that pushes the people to migrate. As a result of the
        collapse of the Asian Hun State, the population concentrated around the
        Caspian and Aral Seas (West Asia), and the increase in the conflicts
        between the tribes in these areas and the westward shift of the
        population started the migration of tribes. These tribes migrated to
        Europe when the Huns, who came to the west of the Volga River, drove the
        tribes living there from their homeland. Tribes who migrated to Europe
        also affected Europe. These migrations proceeded with the referral and
        will of the Hun Khan Balamir at their head.

        Empire and Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine) The Western Roman Empire,

        the merging of barbarian tribes with each other and with the Romans, and

        Medieval Europe by accepting Christianity. As a result, the church,
        papacy and scholastic thought began to gain power in the Middle Ages
        Europe. At the end of the migrations, Visigoths settled in today's
        Spain, Vandals in North Africa, Ostrogoths in Italy, and Franks in
        today's France.
